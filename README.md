## Project Overview

In this project, we developed a database management system for Mr. Alfredo’s detective agency, aimed at organizing and streamlining the management of case-related information. With the rising number and complexity of investigations, the agency faced challenges in handling its data efficiently — prompting the design and implementation of a robust and scalable database solution.

The project followed a structured methodology, beginning with problem contextualization and requirements gathering, followed by conceptual modeling, logical modeling, and physical implementation. Each phase was carefully executed to ensure a normalized and consistent system that supports the agency’s operational needs.

Tools such as [BrModelo](https://www.brmodeloweb.com/lang/pt-br/index.html) (for conceptual modeling) and [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) (for logical and physical implementation) were used to model, create, and validate the system. **SQL** scripts were developed to define entities, enforce data integrity, manage user access, implement data manipulation operations and optimize storage over time.

Area of Application: Design, architecture, modeling, and implementation of a database management system for investigative case management.

Keywords: Cases, Detective, Client, Evidence, Invoice, Type, Requirements, Entities, Relationships, Conceptual model, Logical model, Normalization, Physical model, MySQL Workbench, Databases, SQL Queries
